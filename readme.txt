A really simple way of putting featured posts on your website.

== Description ==

This plugin let's you add - to any spot on your blog's sidebar - a section dedicated to the articles you'd like to highlight. How it works is very simple: once it's installed and activated you can decide which articles to add to the highlights section, how many to display, the display order mode and the size of the image retrieved (it takes the first image in the article and automatically resizes it using the "timthumb.php" script).
